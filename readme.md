# Exam simulator for GCP Professional Architect Certification

This is simple console application with a set of questions copied from the "Official Google Professional Cloud Architect Study Guide" published by Dan Sullivan. 

The project use mysql database to store the topics, questions, options and simulations.

First you must execute the `loadQuestions.py` file to fill the database with the resource files wit all the questions and the right answers.

Then, you can start the simulation executin `simulator.py`. At this moment it iterate for 50 questions. 

Good luck and I hope this helps any one who wants to get the certification.
