Building for Builders LLC manufactures equipment used in residential and commercial building. Each of its 500,000 pieces of equipment in use around the globe has IoT devices collecting data about the state of equipment. The IoT data is streamed from each device every 10 seconds. On average, 10 KB of data is sent in each message. The data will be used for predictive maintenance and product development. The company would like to use a managed database in Google Cloud. What would you recommend?
A. Apache Cassandra
B. Cloud Bigtable
C. BigQuery
D. CloudSQL
1. B. Option B is correct. Bigtable is the best option for streaming IoT data, since it supports low-latency writes and is designed to scale to support petabytes of data. Option A is incor- rect because Apache Cassandra is not a managed database in GCP. Option C is incorrect because BigQuery is an analytics database. While it is a good option for analyzing the data, Bigtable is a better option for ingesting the data. Option D is incorrect. CloudSQL is a managed relational database. The use case does not require a relational database, and Big- table’s scalability is a better fit with the requirements.

You have developed a web application that is becoming widely used. The frontend runs in Google App Engine and scales automatically. The backend runs on Compute Engine in a managed instance group. You have set the maximum number of instances in the backend managed instance group to five. You do not want to increase the maximum size of the managed instance group or change the VM instance type, but there are times the frontend sends more data than the backend can keep up with and data is lost. What can you do to prevent the loss of data?
A. Use an unmanaged instance group
B. Store ingested data in Cloud Storage
C. Have the frontend write data to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic, and have the backend read from that topic
D. Store ingested data in BigQuery
2. C. The correct answer is C. A Cloud Pub/Sub topic would decouple the frontend and backend, provide a managed and scalable message queue, and store ingested data until the backend can process it. Option A is incorrect. Switching to an unmanaged instance group will mean that the instance group cannot autoscale. Option B is incorrect. You could store ingested data in Cloud Storage, but it would not be as performant as the Cloud Pub/Sub solution. Option D is incorrect because BigQuery is an analytics database and not designed for this use case.
